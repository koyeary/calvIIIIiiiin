Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
A portfolio/bio page created with bootstrap
Guidelines
Fulfilled the following guidelines:
	-a nav bar
	-a responsive layout
	-responsive images
	-no use of media queries
Minimum Requirements
Met the following minimum requirements:
-	Functional, deployed application
-	GitHub repository with README describing the project
-	Consistent navbar
-	Navbar with links to Home/About, Portfoli, & Contact. (Because I used a scrolling format, there is also a link to “top of page”
-	All links work
-	Semantic HTML
-	HTML validated using https://validator.w3.org/#textarea
-	Contains my personal information
-	Utilizes Bootstrap components and grid system.

Please note: separate “portfolio” and “contact” files were not included because I used a scrolling format. Links to individual sections are functional.
Bonus
I think scrolling sites are more modern, functional, and aesthetically pleasing, so that’s what I used. I added the following components to optimize this format:
	-a “sticky” navbar that scrolls with the page
	-a “smooth” scroll utility 
	-portfolio section is displayed using a carousel 
	-a jumbotron home screen/ top-of browser 
Built With
•	Bootstrap
Acknowledgments
•	I looked at a ton of developer portfolios to find which bonus elements I wanted to incorporate into the assignment, so thanks to all of them.
